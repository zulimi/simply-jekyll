# Tools and how it helps us

> If we try to use a tool without putting any thought into the way we work with it, even the best tool would not be of much help...And it is indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own needs. -Sönke Ahrens

If we know the tools and why it works for what it intended to do, we will be able to use the tool based on our needs. Example; if we know how graphic design softwares process all the inputs from the user, we would know how to make something that we wantlike manipulating pictures or creating illustrations with it.
