# A new way of taking notes

Today I decided to take note using 1Writer on mobile and Obsidian on Desktop. Notes are sync through dropbox. Easy solutions to try to make fast notes.

- No longer [[202007221519 Sync Notes with Github]] for now
- Not [[202007241545 Using StackEdit to edit file from Github]]
- Revert back from [[202008101335 PARA - A good strategy to organise notes]]

I am also would not be using [[202007230227 Hypothes.is]]. Instead I will use [[202007230228 Zotero]] and do [[202007221009 PDF Annotation]] using Adobe Acrobat or other PDF reader.
