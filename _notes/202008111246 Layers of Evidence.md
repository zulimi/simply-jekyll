# Layers of Evidence

This note made after reading https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/. I found it useful for me to understand that I need to understand information that I read in layers:

1. patterns or description of data
2. interpretation of the data patterns
3. sythesis -  take the entities as building blocks for the bigger picture. make meaning for the context. link to the writing environment. the broader picture or theme.

## Links

- [[202007220104 Learning about zettelkasten]], it is a part of my search for how to do zettels.
