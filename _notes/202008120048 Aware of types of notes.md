# Aware of types of notes

Sohren outline three types of notes:

1. Fleeting notes
2. Permanent notes
3. Project notes

There are big mistakes in keeping those types of notes. *Fleeting notes* would always make a mess when it builds up; clean-ups and unprocessed. if all notes are *Permanent notes*, there would never show the important ideas or connecting ideas that are productive. *Project notes* are bound to only certain project and would not be used for another project.
