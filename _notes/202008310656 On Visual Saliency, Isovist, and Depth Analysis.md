title: 202008310656 On Visual Saliency, Isovist, and Depth Analysis
---

Reading an article by Psarras et al., the idea of wayfinding analysis using Visual Saliency, Isovist and Depth Analysis. The article try to relate the human behavior with the visibility of objects in space. This article suggest additional method to improve researcher's ability to predict and model navigational behaviour in build environment.
