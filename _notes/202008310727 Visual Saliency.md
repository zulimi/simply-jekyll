title: 202008310727 Visual Saliency
---

Visual Saliency is the "subjective perceptual quality some stimuli possess within a visual scene, which makes them stand out from their neighbours and gain the observer's attention" ([Psarras et al., 2019](https://www.zotero.org/users/5985174/items/46IS28G3)). 

One of the first Saliency model is that of Koch which has been extensively used in computer vision to predict eye movements during free-viewing and has been validated in eye tracking studies. (need to find about the paper by Koch and Ullman, 1985). There are more than 50 different saliency models have been developed (highlighted in Zhang and Sclaroff 2013)
